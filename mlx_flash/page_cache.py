"""
page_cache.py — macOS unified page cache management via madvise().

On Apple Silicon macOS the CPU and GPU share the same physical memory (unified
memory architecture).  When model weights are memory-mapped from disk the OS
keeps recently accessed pages in this shared pool.  Crucially:

  * Metal can directly read from mmap'd pages — no extra VRAM copy.
  * madvise(MADV_WILLNEED) prefetches pages from SSD into RAM proactively.
  * madvise(MADV_FREE) releases pages the OS may reclaim without a syscall
    from any reader — the fastest eviction path on macOS ≥14.
  * madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) is advisory only on macOS (unlike Linux where it
    clears pages immediately), but still signals LRU priority.

We obtain the virtual address of a Python mmap region via ctypes, which is
safe as long as the mmap object is kept alive.

This module is macOS-only.  On other platforms all functions are no-ops so
that the rest of the code runs in CI (Linux / Windows).
